    "## Probabilistic Checking of Polynomials\n",
    "If two polynomials $f(X)$ and $g(X)$ are both of degree at most $d$, the Verifier only needs to provide a random challenge value $\\zeta\\in \\mathbb{F}$ and check whether $f(\\zeta)$ equals $g(\\zeta)$. This will, with high probability, determine whether $f(X) = g(X)$, with an error probability of $\\leq\\frac{d}{|\\mathbb{F}|}$​. As long as $\\mathbb{F}$ is sufficiently large, the probability of error can be negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result is known as the Schwartz-Zippel lemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to verify whether two vectors $\\vec{a} + \\vec{b}$ equal $\\vec{c}$, we first encode the three vectors into polynomials to enable a single-step challenge verification.\n",

    "If we want to verify $\\vec{a}\\circ\\vec{b}\\overset{?}{=}\\vec{c}$, the coefficient encoding method becomes less convenient because $a(X)\\cdot b(X)$ generates many cross-terms. Moreover, the terms $a_i\\cdot b_i$ and $c_i$ do not correspond to the coefficients of $X^i$. For example, the coefficient of $a_1\\cdot b_1$ appears in the $X^2$ term, but the coefficient of $X^2$ also includes contributions from the cross-terms $a_0\\cdot b_2$ and $a_2\\cdot b_0$, while $c_1$ is $X^1$ the coefficient of $X^1$.\n",

Let $N=2^{k}, k\\leq\\lambda$. Then, there exists a multiplicative subgroup of order $N$, denoted as $H$. This subgroup must have a generator, denoted as $\\omega$, satisfying $\\omega^N = 1$. This is equivalent to taking the $N$-th root of unity, hence the name \"roots of unity.\" However, there is not just one root of unity $\\omega$; we find that $\\omega^2,\\omega^3,\\ldots,\\omega^{N-1}$ also satisfy the property of roots of unity, i.e., $(\\omega^k)^N=1, k\\in(2,3,\\ldots,N-1)$.

    "### e.g.: boundary conditions\n",
    "Now suppose we wanted to constrain the first element of the vector $\\vec{a}=(a_0,a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{N-2},a_{N-1})$ to be $a_0 = v_1$，and the last element to be $a_{N-2} = h_2$，and the other elements to be arbitrary. Then $a(X)$ should satisfy the following two constraints:\n",

    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "L_0(X)\\cdot (a(X)-h_1) &= 0, \\quad \\forall X\\in H\\\\\n",

    "\\end{split}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, by using a random challenge $\\alpha$ from the Verifier ($\\alpha$), the two constraints above can be merged into a single polynomial constraint:\n",

    "L_0(X)\\cdot (a(X)-h_1) + \\alpha\\cdot L_{n-1}(X)\\cdot(a(X)-h_2) = 0, \\quad \\forall X\\in H\n",

    "### e.g.: quality except the first element\n",
    "Now, suppose we wanted to verify that two vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ of equal length are identical except for the first element. How do we express this as a polynomial constraint? Suppose $a(X)$ and $b(X)$ are the polynomial encodings of the two vectors, then they should satisfy:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $X = \\omega^0$, the first factor of the polynomial on the left-hand side equals zero. When $X \\in H \\setminus \\{\\omega^0\\}$, the second factor on the left-hand side equals zero. This means that except for the first element, all other points must have identical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, by using Lagrange polynomials, we can flexibly constrain the relationships between multiple vectors, and we can combine multiple constraints into one, allowing the Verifier to validate multiple vector constraints with just a few random challenges.\n",

    "## Coset\n",
    "In the multiplicative group of a finite prime field, for each multiplicative subgroup $H$, there are multiple cosets of the same length. These cosets have properties similar to $H$, and the concept of cosets is also used in Plonk. Here, we will briefly introduce some of their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking $\\mathbb{F}_{13}$​ as an example, we choose $H=(1,5,12,8)$, and the generator of the multiplicative group is $g=2$. We can then obtain the following two cosets:\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that $\\mathbb{F}^*_{13}=H\\cup H_1 \\cup H_2$, and their intersection is empty, meaning there is no overlap. Moreover, their Vanishing polynomials can be quickly computed as:\n",
