    "# Understanding PLONK (Part 1): Plonkish Arithmetization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetization refers to the process of transforming computations into probabilistically checkable statements for the purpose of zero-knowledge proofs. Plonkish arithmetization is a specific arithmetization method unique to the Plonk proof system. Before the advent of Plonkish, the mainstream circuit representation was R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint Systems), widely adopted by systems like Pinocchio, Groth16, and Bulletproofs. In 2019, the Plonk scheme proposed a seemingly retro circuit encoding method. However, by leveraging polynomial encoding to its fullest, Plonk is no longer limited to just \"addition gates\" and \"multiplication gates\" in arithmetic circuits. Instead, it supports more flexible \"custom gates\" and \"lookup gates.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's revisit R1CS circuit encoding, which is the most widely discussed arithmetization scheme. Then, we will introduce Plonkish encoding in comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arithmetic Circuits and R1CS Arithmetization\n",
    "\n",
    "An arithmetic circuit consists of multiple multiplication and addition gates. Each gate has two input wires and one output wire. Any output wire can be connected to multiple input wires of other gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a very simple arithmetic circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "          out\n",
    "           |\n",
    "           *\n",
    "         /   \\\n",

    " /     \\       /     \\\n",
    "x1     x2     x3      2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This circuit represents the following computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(x_1 + x_2) \\cdot (2\\cdot x_3) = out\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit has four variables: three input variables $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and one output variable $out$. Additionally, there is a constant input with a value of $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A circuit has two states: a \"blank state\" and a \"computation state.\" When the input variables have no specific values, the circuit is in the \"blank state.\" In this state, we can only describe the relationships between the circuit's wires, i.e., the circuit's structural topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question is how to encode the \"blank state\" of the circuit, i.e., encode the positions of the gates and the connections between their wires.\n",
    "\n",
    "R1CS uses the multiplication gates as the central focus, employing three \"selector\" matrices to \"select\" which variables are connected to the \"left input,\" \"right input,\" and \"output\" of each multiplication gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first look at the left input of the top multiplication gate in the diagram, which can be described using the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "1 & x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & out \\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This table has only one row, so we can represent it with a vector $U=(0,1,1,0,0)$ indicating that the left input of the multiplication gate is connected to two variables, $x_1$ and $x_2$. Note that all addition gates are expanded into the sum (or linear combination) of multiple variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, consider the right input, which is connected to one variable $x_3$ and a constant value, equivalent to connecting $x_3$ multiplied by two. Thus, the right input selector matrix can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "1 & x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & out \\\\\n",

    "0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we can also use a row vector $V=(0,0,0,2,0)$ to represent this, where the $2$ corresponds to the constant wire in the circuit diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the output of the multiplication gate can be described as $W=(0,0,0,0,1)$，producing the output variable $out$：\n",

    "Since R1CS encoding is centered around multiplication gates, the addition gates in the circuit do not increase the number of rows in the $U, V$, and $W$ matrices, thus having little impact on the Prover's performance. The encoding of R1CS circuits is clear and simple, making it conducive to constructing various SNARK schemes on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 2019 Plonk paper, the encoding scheme requires encoding both addition and multiplication gates, which seemingly increases the number of constraints and reduces proving performance. However, the Plonk team subsequently introduced gates beyond multiplication and addition, such as gates for range checks, XOR operations, and more. Moreover, Plonk supports any gate whose input-output relationship satisfies a polynomial equation, known as Custom Gates, as well as state transition gates suitable for implementing RAM. With the introduction of lookup gates, Plonk has gradually become the preferred scheme for many applications, and its encoding method has been given a specific name: Plonkish.\n",

This construction treats the arithmetic circuit as consisting solely of multiplication gates, but each gate can have multiple input pins (up to the total number of wires). In contrast, Plonkish treats addition and multiplication gates equally, and since each gate has only two input pins, the width of the $W$ table is fixed at three columns (it can be extended to more columns if advanced computation gates are supported). This characteristic is a prerequisite for Plonk to implement copy constraints using the Permutation Argument.\n",
